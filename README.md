# Panorama Stitching using SIFT/SURF/ORB Descriptors

## Overview

This repository contains code for creating stunning panoramic images by stitching together multiple overlapping images. The panorama stitching process leverages feature descriptors, including SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform), SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features), and ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF), to identify matching keypoints and align images seamlessly.

## Features

- **Feature Extraction:** Utilize feature extraction algorithms (SIFT, SURF, ORB) to detect key points in images and compute their descriptors.

- **Key Point Matching:** Find matching keypoints between adjacent images to identify overlapping regions.

- **Image Alignment:** Accurately align images based on matched keypoints and compute the transformation needed for each image.

- **Panorama Stitching:** Combine aligned images to create a single, seamless panoramic image.

- **Choice of Descriptors:** Experiment with different feature descriptors (SIFT, SURF, ORB) to understand their impact on stitching quality.
